Application of Natural Language Processing in Education There are a number of different effective approaches, which assist in the process of e-learning and using web based current information related to the educational course and curriculum. E-learning applications and tools provide assistance for the learners to improve their education. Teachers also assist their students for enhancing their skills and knowledge for getting current information using the online resources, which assists in getting information from the online sources. NLP is also very effective for providing knowledge and information to the students for application of e-learning and NLP in understanding and dealing with the need of analyzing text. Understanding of text is based on the development of research-based analysis of the general and contextual learning. \n",

What makes speech recognition especially challenging is the way people talk—quickly, slurring words together, with varying emphasis and intonation, in different accents, and often using incorrect grammar. Part of speech tagging, also called grammatical tagging, is the process of determining the part of speech of a particular word or piece of text based on its use and context. Part of speech identifies ‘make’ as a verb in ‘I can make a paper plane,’ and as a noun in ‘What make of car do you own?’ Word sense disambiguation is the selection of the meaning of a word with multiple meanings  through a process of semantic analysis that determine the word that makes the most sense in the given context.

Spam detection is one of a handful of NLP problems that experts consider 'mostly solved' (although you may argue that this doesn’t match your email experience). Machine translation: Google Translate is an example of widely available NLP technology at work.
